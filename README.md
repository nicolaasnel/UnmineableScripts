# UnminableAlternatingStart
 A simple windows batch script to start mining a different coin every day

These scripts use [NBMiner](https://github.com/NebuTech/NBMiner) and [Unminable](https://unmineable.com/) to alternate between payouts of SHIB and DASH on every startup. The actual algo being mined is kawpow.

## Getting started
1. Copy `config.cmd.example` to `config.cmd` and update the variables required.
1. Run the script `.\start_mining.bat yes` to start mining. Leave out the `yes` parameter to always mine the same coin.

## Info
This was intended to be used via scheduled tasks to startup a different payout method daily as a fun project.
